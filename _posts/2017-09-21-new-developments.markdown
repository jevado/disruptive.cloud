A few days ago [AWS announced per second billing][aws-news], something I think every AWS user should be very excited about. If you have properly set up your architecture, this will definitely lower your AWS bill significantly.

The announcement got me wondering, why did they announce this now? Their yearly event, Re:Invent, is 2 months away and I think this absolutely is a keynote worthy announcement. On the other hand, other big competitors have had per second billing for their compute services quite some time now.  This might mean that this isn't as PR worthy as I initially thought.

Thinking about this and Re:Invent also makes me wonder what they actually will announce at the event. I do have some thoughts about it which I'll put on paper the upcoming days. In the meantime, I'd love to hear your thoughts about this as well
