An extra post this week, something I'm really enthusiastic about!

Through a newsletter from [cbinsights][cbinsights] I stumbled upon another [newsletter from Finimize][finimize-signup]. Since the financial crisis started around 2008, I've been very interested in how global financial markets work and I now wish that I had discovered them earlier and they where around back then. 

If you're not a financial, or even when you are, and want to get a feel for what is happening financially globally without having to know jargon, you can [signup][finimize-signup] for their newsletter for free. The newsletter will take you around 3 minutes to read every day and I really like the way they structure the articles. They really prove that finance doesn't have to be rocket science.

Still not convinced? Check out an [example newsletter][finimize-example] on Netflix and Pearson
